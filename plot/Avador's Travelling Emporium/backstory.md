# The Setting

Our campaign unfolds in a universe where "light travel" forms the backbone of the economy. The essential ingredients of this transportation method are dragon glass and a pearl produced by a specially bred oyster. The oyster pearls are particularly coveted, as they require skilled magical biologists and specific large-scale environments for successful cultivation.

The creators of this recipe were a mad geneticist, now quarantined due to a failed experiment, and a former real estate tycoon turned planeswalker.

The production process of the spheres themselves involves grinding the obsidian and pearl, blending them with other trace components, and then fusing them together in a furnace using antigravity spellwork to form perfect spherical lenses. These are Light Stones, the devices enabling light travel. They work only by line of sight through mostly transparent materials, and are thus often perched in towers and other high places.

The biological source of these pearls was once a secret, with many disastrous and horrific attempts made to reproduce them. Some claim to have successfully replicated the pearls using their own special breeding techniques, or doping methods, but they kept their methods hidden and any that were legitimate have never quite matched the success rate of the original.

Our story starts at the end of the race to create a stone that enables travel through solid earth. The stone is being developed in a secret research lab deep under the ocean, filled with blood and horror.

But at the same time, an unknown source has publicly released a manufacturing recipe for the standard pearl that any common wizard could execute. The result is non-biological, but it is stable and not plagued with the transfer errors of the others. This new version of the "standard pearl", along with the necessary antigravity spellwork for the glass furnace has given an opening to anyone to being manufacturing their own light stones. No longer are biologists or oyster farms necessary. They've been rendered obsolete overnight, unless the earth stone can be realized.

This has changed the game, and all of a sudden everyone wants to set up light stone manufacturing plants. The risk of the earth stone being developed by a 3rd party has become real. There is no closing the floodgates on the release though, and all the forces on the island are having to realign to the new democratization of their prized commodities.

Nevermind the zombie disease that's ravaging the nation. We'll talk about that later.

# Avador's Expedition

Avador, our leading NPC for session zero, is an interdimensional explorer. One of the few people with a ship able to travel between the campaign's pocket universe and the greater multiverse beyond.

Avador operates a massive lighthouse ship that contains essentially a floating city block. It is teeming with shops and people, and feels like a never-ending outdoor market. It is connected to the light network (when in range of another relay) by a massive lighthouse that is perched atop the ship's architecture.

Avador's ship is one of the few that is licensed to travel beyond the pocket dimension that makes up the entirety of the campaign world. His ship and its mission is mostly financed by a contract to find new oyster species for breeding and pearl development. He also was able to secure a contract to anchor new light stones in other worlds to enable efficient outside "port" connections to the network. These were both endeavors backed by the campaign's government as they aim to expand the light network, but his oyster contract at least is now under threat, if not the whole government in general.

As self-reliant tinkerer and adventurer himself, he relates to all the characters as young versions of himself, and takes them under his wing. They may be drawn into his adventures as he tries to navigate his financial stability in new ways.

He has in his mind he may circumvent al of this by a method of travel that he is actively trying to manufacture himself: enchanted doorknobs that link to a network of hallways in his own pocket dimension. He sees this as an improvement to the light network that is limited by line of sight amplifiers, but his inventions have not yet panned out. He has finally saved enough money to get the materials for the pocket dimension's anchor. (He essentially has the money to develop the land, but hasn't connected it to the utilities or built anything on it)

# Character Motivations

As the ship arrives, players should be swept up in the excitement of a fantastical traveling magical market. Various crew members of the ship present a view of the places the ship has been and the politics involved in the communities.

There are opportunities for different motivations and roles, tempting players with new and alien worlds. Characters and inhabitants give a view into the small town gypsy life of traders and tinkers on the road.

But the true motivations of the encounter are to take the player's characters back to the beleaguered island of the campaign that the ship originates from.

The ship has a reputation for shanghaiing people, adding an element of risk and intrigue in case players aren't enchanted with all this new fangled finery.

# The Infection

The campaign world the characters are whisked away to is plagued by a zombie infection, a byproduct of a mad biologist's immortality experiment. This is the same biologist known for first breeding the oysters used in light stone production.

The rogue infection is transmitted through blood and so generally required breaking the skin. It results in death within an hour, followed by a type of reanimation. Only 1 in 20 on average retain their self-awareness, while the rest lose control, driven by a fungal infection that drives them to attack and thus infect others.

Those who do retain control after infection though are, in essence, immortal. Their flesh does continue to decay as it normally would after death though, making it a perilous sort of immortality requiring active upkeep to prevent flesh rot. Those left in this state, sentient or not, also continue to suffer from strong urges to harm other living beings and are drawn to the scent of CO2.

The more thoughtful and brave take to a "living mummification" during the death hour that generally preserves some level of flesh indefinitely. They are generally fanatical researchers of the infection itself, or those desperate for power, or just plain desperate.

## The Fermentation Cult

A cult has formed around this process of using the infection with a ritualized mummification process towards lichdom.

They infect willing (and sometimes unwilling) participants in the hope of achieving the elusive self-aware infection. These rituals often result in the unintentional release of the zombie infection into nearby towns, and are essentially mass suicide events and should be handled delicately by the DM and the characters.

The cult is perpetuated by a common invention that was sold to the public to help alleviate the infection's spread. It isolates any infection generally in an individual to a specific body part, preventing the death and resurrection needed for the mental degradation. You could use it for a snake or spider bite for instance.

These are made as bands of silver that are designed to draw a small amount of the wearer's own blood for enchantment. Even though they were once used to control the infection, alternate uses have made them a common black market currency.
