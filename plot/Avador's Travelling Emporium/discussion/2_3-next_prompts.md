# Living on the Road

What other small communities survive on the road, or are generally migratory? How do they live, and what are their daily patterns?

What should I be aware of about the daily lives of the ships inhabitants, and how can I prepare my NPCs and my session for encounters with the player's characters?

# Small Town Adventures

Could you please compare daily life on the ship to daily life in a small town? How might the characters go about their day to day business around each other?
- Everyone knows everyone. Everyone is in everyone's business
- You don't pick your partner, you wait your turn and see who sticks
- You either work in the family business or you leave town
- Social dynamics are much larger parts of your life

# Plot Arcs for Each Faction

What plot arcs could I make that tie the rise and fall of each of these factions together in an interesting way? How could the players get involved in a way that makes them feel like a part of the change?

A reminder that the factions are essentially:
- dragons
- biologist wizards
- non-biologist wizards
- the cult of fermentation
- civilians

Please give some imagined or supposed context for these arecs based on the backstory and setting.

# Plot Hook Characters

Could you please expand on the following characters so they connect the players to the plots of each political faction.

1. **Zael**: A representative from the Dragon faction who runs a black-market operation dealing in light stones. He is a cunning businessman and always seems to have a stash of light stones that aren't regulated by the government.

2. **Dr. Elia**: A human biologist who's been exiled from the mainland due to her 'unorthodox' experiments. She runs a small medical clinic and laboratory on the ship, providing healthcare services to the passengers and crew while also continuing her research into the fungal infection. She represents the Wizards faction.

3. **Ferris**: A fervent follower of the Church of Fermentation who runs a brewery on the ship. His establishment serves as a gathering place for like-minded individuals who seek to 'distill' rather than expand.

4. **Glim**: One of the "gnomes", who runs a shop selling finely-crafted items of clothing and exquisite jewelry. He is seen as eccentric by many of the passengers, but his charming, gnome-like demeanor and his knack for going unnoticed make him a good source of information.

## Interactions

What types of interactions are there? Relationships? Working, academic, social, romantic, etc...?

Designs quests or interactions of some other kind (party, festival, class, shopping, etc...) with each of the above characters that lead them to the associated intrigue.
