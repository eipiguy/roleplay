I can't believe I went this long without a centralized log of what I've been doing. I still haven't quite figured out how to plan and manage tasks effectively, but I think I have a good system down with the logging.

### Cyclopes

I recently discovered that the Joule Thief is a cyclops. I started looking into cyclopes, and I found their history and mention quite intriguing. They seem to function as precursors to Hephaestus. Often as boot-strapped McGuffins to make the things that everything else relies on.

I think they may be more fleshed out in Roman rather than greek mythology. They have a round eye in the middle of their forehead. What is in place of where their normal eyes would be? Have they closed or sacrificed them for their third, and now only, eye?

Situations and events produce thoughts and emotions in their observers. Thoughts and emotions produce actions and behavior in these observers, which in turn sets off more situations and events. The noise does not happen in the real world, it happens in the minds of the observers.

In many ways, the thoughts and emotions of observers are a black box we cannot know.

It does seem that observers settle into patterns though. They either reach an equilibrium state, or adopt certain habitual patterns, if left unattended.

These small experiments in how specific changes to specific variables effect the system is how many scientific fields have developed. I have faith in it, though I always worry about implications of forging powerful tools to be used by the just and unjust alike.
