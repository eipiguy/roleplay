# Morals

Every story has a moral. People will take one away from the story, whether you craft it or not, so better to craft it openly and honestly.

Do your best so that the details are filled in to match the theme you intended, but don't stifle flavorful creations, explorations, and little bits of new magic. (exploration is one of my favorite themes)

## Overall

I want this to be a story of joy and magic. Odd and strange, but non-threatening, friendly, and un-intrusive (unless truly desired). A gentle tree on a hill. Mangled and twisted, maybe slightly abused, but beautiful and full. Bearing fruit into endless years of good weather and interesting times.

I want it to be proof that rule-of-cool is the best. That letting go and having fun is ok, so long as you aren't stomping on people, and you're living with a good heart.

Is a good heart something you can build? What makes a good heart?

## Session 0 - "That's No Moon!"

The morals here should center on discovery.

1. First discovering your group: the band! What is their name?! (even though you want it to be yourself you discover first, the lesson is that you only exist through the perspectives of others, so others must see you first)

2. Then discovering yourself in the context of the people that matter to you. The people you want to be like and the ones you don't want to become.

### "I like hearing about myself from other people's perspective."

A friendly stranger asks you about them on the street. "What are they like?" ("What's their last name?!" Think of Christof from Disney's Frozen interrogating Anna about marrying Prince Hans)

### What do I want them to think?
