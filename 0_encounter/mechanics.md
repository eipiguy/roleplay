# Mechanics

All **actions** are possible if they are in a player's **realm of control**.

A player's **realm of control** is anything that they can reasonably explain the execution of, based on their agreed upon skills.

If at any time a player questions the actions of an individual, a formal **contest** may be requested by either party, and the other must accept.

## Contests

To contest an action, you must be able to explain why, even if just because, and then present an opposing action. The parties to this opposing action must be in the control of the opposing players.

A **contest** is then "a way of deciding the **feasibility** of a desire with respect to the observing parties.

Each contest should have a collection of _mutually exclusive_ **opposers**. There may not be a lot, or there may be many, but they must be set up so that each is managed with regards to the others.

Together, each character involved in the contest may have one entry as to their desired outcome, but they may be admitted only upon agreement by at least one admin.

There is a then single outcome, decided at random by a series of fair coin flips amongst the parties, first come first serve, where any contest between opposers is also decided by fair coin flip.

Each player opposing the action has a single chance to thwart it.

A **contest** is then a sequence of **chances for an action to fail**. But because it is your own choice, you must see it also as a **chance to participate where else the story would go on without you**.

If you fail a challenge to an opposer, as a consolation you may save an extra future chance to succeed.

That is to say, tally a mark so that if you come into a failing contest again, you may use your stored chance for one additional attempt at success. (A redo.)

You may also use these stored chances to oppose an action more effectively. That is, if you find that in opposing the actions of another character, you fail, instead you may spend a stored chance at success for one more attempt to oppose that action.

## Records

A contest is a choice. Won or lost, the choice and its outcome should be recorded. Each choice says something about the characters who made them, and who opposed them.

When a choice is made, any identical situations should expect an identical response without some additional change. Similar situations provoke similar responses, and a situations similarity to a particular character can be measured in terms of the similarity of their response.

"Character", or "identity", resists change.
