# Recruiting

Not representative from each option, but rather options that fit desires.

What do they want to be? Give them a chance to be that.

How?

## Who Does the Deed?

A single recruiter for the band, a hook for every desire. Each hook is an opportunity to fulfil that desire, if they wish. It should seem like chance, but the only chance should be the player's response.

To do this, in turn order, make the next NPC character they interact with is now a specialist in a "magical version" of a field they wish they knew more about.

"But I don't know anything about that!" I hear you say.

Fear not. You are going to a magical, foreign place, where things are different. They may like to learn more about "fishing", and maybe you can't teach them, but you can make up "magical fishing" as you go!

Magical fishing is a different kind of fishing, where all the hard parts are gone, and only the fun remains!

"But that was the whole point!" the disgruntled player will complain.

"Oh?" says you, "Do tell! What is fishing like in your world? What makes it nice, and how can we fix that here?"

By the end of an open conversation about what they really want, you'll have invented some weird hybrid magic fishing scheme that everyone will remember. Maybe you walk away with dinner, maybe you get to keep the fishing-rod-equivalents.

This isn't just for fishing. Make this a similar conversation for whatever the player seems drawn to.

Make every encounter a chance for the player to express themselves.

## How to when you can't

The real problem is often we are the blind leading the blind. Neither of us knows anything about fishing, and while we may want to learn, we're just imagining for now.

So we invent a magical version that doesn't actually exist so we can pretend "we already know everything about that!".

Let their actions and words tell you what they're looking for. Try to give them a space to be that, and fill in any details you need to make it work.

Wild zany things are fine, just play it cool and go along with what people are in to.
