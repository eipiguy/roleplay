The Cyclopes. Poseidon's trident. Hades' cap of invisibility.

## Lighthouse Island

Just enough for a family of hermits to survive alone.

A few chickens and dairy cows. One missing bull, and two roosters strung to opposite ends of a house patio.

A garden of strange vegetables no one can identify that seem to move.

You could swear the plant on the patio looks like a weird succulant bush made of fingers.

#### Tinker

This looks like the wizard at first glance, but he just runs the lighthouse. The Joule Thief is in the inter-dimensional lab in the basement.

What does it take to get in?

### Laboratory by the Menagerie

#### Prometheus

The gods are coming for their liver, but they play the long game. Ergodic.
