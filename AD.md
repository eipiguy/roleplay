# All Bard Party

You want to matter and you don't. You want to change things and you can't.
You want somewhere better.
You want a land of imagination,
of freedom and adventure!

You need a band!

Isn't that why you're here?
Isn't that why you want to role play?!

Fun! Glory! Companionship!

>That's what I'm looking for anyway. ;)

Follow me into a floating head in space!
I'll show you an immortal land of bounty where nothing dies!

There, you will be the greatest band that ever was!

---

This **one-shot homebrew adventure** will take your **all bard party**, and give each player a chance to mold their particular bard into a more developed character for further adventures.

It will imbue flat characters with desires and drives, and give them skills and a natural history, and maybe a few magic items along the way. ;)

## Homebrew

My goal as an administrator is to try out a new system of mechanics I designed:

---

To start you make a sort of "audition sheet" for your character in the band, as if they were responding to an ad on Craigslist looking for a musician:

- What instrument do they play?
- What kind of music do they enjoy?
- What kind of music do they play themselves?
- Can they read sheet music or jazz changes, or do they play with tabs and by ear?

- What kind of music do they look like they enjoy?
- How did they get into music?
- Who are they outside of music life?

---

In addition you must make an animal helper. This can be a pet or a wild animal, but it must be something you could see naturally in your location, and not only in a zoo.

---

On the plot side, all actions are coin flip votes, with the administrator voting for the NPCs.

If anything comes into question,

- We **first flip a fair coin** to determine if an action succeeds.
- Each **character** is then given a chance to contribute a coin flip, challenging the action **in narrative**.
- Each **player** is then given a chance to flip one of their three "**supernatural challenge**" coins as a response to the in-narrative outcome.
  - These are resolved as "_Deus ex machina_" in-narrative.

---

For example, if a player says "I do this!", and it sounds contrary, or suspect; anyone may call a challenge. Players or administrator.

"I'm not sure you can do that. Let's flip for it."

The administrator will describe the action evolving in more detail, and **flip a coin for fate, calling how it will land**.

If the coin agrees, the action succeeds.
If the coin disagrees, the action fails.

This is unless there are additional challengers to administer *final justice*.

### Fate Says "Yes"

There are no NPCs involved, so only the characters are the nearby party members.

"The coin said yes. Any of your characters want to do anything about that in-game?"

- "Nah."
- "She's suspicious, but no, she'll go along with it."

"Idk, what do you really think players? Do we let them get away with this?"

- "Hell no! Are you nuts?! Challenge!" *flips a coin onto the table* "Aw. Fiiine..."
- "I think it might be reasonable. I'll pass"
- "Sure, why not?"
- "They can't do that! My character wasn't allowed to last session! Challenge!" *flips a coin onto the table* "Haha! See? Fate says no!"

"Alright. That's a successful challenge. You attempt to do the thing, but something happens! You slip or stumble and lose focus for a second. In that moment of lapse, you lose sight of what you are doing, and the plan crumbles."

### Fate Says "No"


"The coin said no. Anyone's character want to help out in-game?"

- "I've got their back!" *Flip* "Aw, I tried..."
- "Yeah, let me give them a hand" *flip* "Crap."

"Anyone else in-game? No?"

"Alright, well the coin said no. What do you think players?

Anyone want to offer some supernatural support?
Who _believes_ they can do it? Who wants to try to intercede on high?"

- "No way! It didn't work out for me, why should I waste my wish on them? Pass."
- "That would be so cool though! I'll spend one." *flips coin* "Oh nooooo! awwww... I tried. =("
- "Dude, I know you worked hard... I'll help." *flip* "Niiiiiice! Yeeeaaaah!!! =D"

"Alright! That's a successful support! You challenged fate and won!

You attempted to do the thing, and everyone thought it was out of your league.Even for a moment there, maybe you doubted yourself, but then you remembered.
You catch a glimpse of all the moments that have put you here, guiding you, and preparing you for this moment.

You could always make it happen, with or without fate's help."

### Records are Precedent

Keep record of all challenges:

- Who was challenged?
- What in-game characters opposed them?
- What was the result for each?

Any time a situation comes up again, refer to the **records before challenges** are allowed. Precedent wins unless the situation has changed.

To **try a previously failed action**, or to **restrict an previously successful action** you must challenge the precedent itself.

To **challenge a precedent**, explain how the situation is different, then characters and players vote with flips again, and the **challenge to the action** is then allowed to proceed, with any new result nullifying the original precedent.
