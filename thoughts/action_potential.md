# Running the Game

## Timing

You only have the time everyone agreed to for the session. Normally 3 hours, give or take. A shorter game would be closer to 2 hours, and a longer game might stretch to 4.

Any game longer than that is beyond the scope of this document.

Knowing in advance what to get through, your job is moving through that material. Present choices or intrigue to keep things fresh and move it along.

Be aware a "one-shot" campaign will often take 5 sessions if you play it too chill.

>**Be a Coordinator.**
>Imagine you are running a train that must keep a tight schedule. You want to be lenient to anyone you can, but you have passengers that are trusting you to get them there on time!

### Action Potential

How do you help the quiet ones speak up? How do you teach the loud ones to make room?

My attempt here is to give each player an "action potential" that they unknowingly use as they play, and you as the coordinator keep track of in secret.

It is adjusted into a handicap using the last session to tell you how much "action" a player got in that episode.

You spend your action potential when you are the center of the action, others gain potential by playing a part in the "action".

To play a part in the action, you must say or do something that helps the player who is the center of the action.

>I do not think this is necessarily how the world works. You often find "you give and give and no one notices!"
>But you also notice that everyone feels that way.
>
>If both people are doing their best, but neither thinks the other is accomplishing anything...
>Are you measuring on actual effort, or your version of it? Are you training in a helpful way? Are you contributing at all? If *you* want a thing to happen, that's on *you*.
>
>The only thing you can expect of a friend, is that they try their best to act in your best interest when they can.
>
> Because people always act in *their* own best interests when *they* can. You can't expect the dice to always fall in their favor. Why would they? Just because they are helping you?
>
>But as a coordinator, you might be able to make them. If they put in the effort, help make the dice fall in their favor.

### How do you enforce this?

Attention. The plot equivalent of initiative.

You think the turn-based system is done just because you aren't rolling dice to kill monsters anymore, but it's not. You keep track of who's next in line to talk all the time as the coordinator. NPCs, players, monsters, items... it makes no difference.

But you can't give it to them directly all the time, you can just take it away from others.

If someone has been talking too long, "Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I want to give everyone a chance to respond before I push the next plot hook. Does anyone else want to do anything?"

Take their token and stick it at the back of the line.

"[insert name here], what do you think? Do you want to do [likely option here], or say anything?" if not, take their token and stick it at the back of the line.

Make the rounds, and if no one else in the queue want to act, and there's still time, let the person you interrupted take over again.

"Alright, looks like we're good, sorry to break the flow. Do you want to [what they were doing] again, or did you have a new idea for something else?"

Be careful of fronting people; that's more likely to not result in them actually enjoying the experience.

But conversations *are* turn based by nature. It's like telling a linear story, you need to be fair if you want everyone to have lines in the script.

### Moving it Along

In this case there are two types of actions:
- actions that help each player self-actualize (above)
- actions that contribute to the central plot

In the same way that the players must be a part of the "action", so too does the coordinator. The coordinator is the one trying to keep the train on schedule. Do they get action in the same way as the players?

How do you get to the end of the episode so as to make the connection to the next one? I can't expect anyone reading this to re-shuffle every episode, or make them on the fly.

>Any mentions of "being railroaded" should be met with something like "This campaign is a train, and I keep a tight schedule! Regardless of our route!"

## Avatars

You are a player. You play as characters in the game. If you become known, as a player, in the game world to game characters, then to your characters, you are the authors of their fate.

That is an impenetrable boundary for them to cross, but you as a player cross it with your will. Your characters speak for you. They are your "avatars". Is it willingly that they do your bidding?

Being true to character is about doing what the character would do, not what you would. You have to see the character in yourself. You must if not become that character temporarily, put on the mask so as to try out the fit.

That is only crossable if your characters are truly your "avatars". Those characters are following your will in conjunction with their own, are called your "avatars".
