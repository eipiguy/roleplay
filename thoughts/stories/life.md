## Birth

## Life

### Childhood

You begin as the aspirations of your family. A mother and a father. Regardless of how they came together or why, the origins of a life start at its creation. That currently means biology, emotions, situations, and relationships, amongst other things.

### Adulthood

#### Parenthood

Parenthood is a chance and a choice. Do you continue the cycle? What of your childhood would you repeat or propogate?

What would you change and how? Git diffs are easier to track ;)

The more important lessons seem to be about what is new. What is outside the cycle that is worth bringing back in? Can you understand how your life ties in to what came before? What role do you predict we have to play in what will come after?

### Old Age

## Death
