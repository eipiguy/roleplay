# Humanity

We are not yet who we want to be. Like a legacy software company full of spaghetti code, we are reactionary. Hair on fire, bugs in the furniture, tech debt hoarding reactionary.

We consume any dense energy source we can get our hands on for fear we won't have enough. We are so starved as to fight over it. More than squabble, but plot, scheme, and murder in a hot rage. We rage against the cage in which we find ourselves, but never find the time to plan ahead.

"Life feeds on death!" we scream. "Soylent green is people!"

But like the Smashing Pumpkins say, we're still just rats in a cage.

We must consume to survive. We need abundance. Our existence is about transfer and growth. Organization. The piling of rocks one on another. We need more rocks! A superabundance of rocks! Endless rocks!

Because when we're out of rocks, we'll settle for bones, and that's a problem. We've been out of rocks for millennia.

Were there ever even any real rocks to begin with? It's bones all the way down.
