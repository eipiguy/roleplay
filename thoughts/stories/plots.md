## I'm Special

The only "true" view of the world is mine. All others are an illusions, or a dream. Solipsicm?

We are all born into an existence like the matrix, right before the dawn of GAI. This mirrors a meta game being played with our sense of self.

We do not know who we are, or why we are here, and the closer we get to understanding, the closer we get to general artificial intelligence: creating a new consciousness, and not just a new biological life.

## Binary Themes

But the themes should always point at a resolution to the user's perceived evils about the theme. It should force perspectives of "the other" in their story, if there is one, and there is always one. One vs. Other, Self as Other, and Man vs. Nature stories can all be centered on the "One", but they should not be. They should shift the focus from the one to the center.

Does this require a backlash?
