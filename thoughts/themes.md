# Themes of the World

I'm learning that I like certain themes for this world that I'm building. I will need justifications for them, but I like the idea of starting with certain themes.

## Most Things Are Possible

In a world where it seems like everything takes money and teams of people, here what if everyone could make a nuclear bomb and anthrax in their garage? What if everything were possible with minimal effort and a bit of grit and determination?

This is changing the base resources that everyone uses. How will it change their "industry verticals"?

It would really be determined by costs. What was expensive that would now be cheap? What are people only doing because they can't afford or achieve otherwise?

The best stories in this world are about new discoveries that send waves of change through a society that has grown accustomed to these huge shifts in lifestyle and technology.

**What if you really could do anything if you set your mind to it?** Magic is real, but it's not magic, it's cheap science on steroids. How did you shoot fire out of your arm? Either tech or biological alteration, maybe some runic connection with a dark mystic dimension. What did you trade for it? Oh, it's paid for by ads, he just told be about his new book over coffee before he gave me the access key.

It all becomes very "Rick & Morty" very quickly, and you have to figure out how things settle down, or at least how to navigate life.

## Life is Weird

Animals and plants aren't the same here. The same way you can clone a plant by splitting it, you might be able to cut the arm off an animal and grow another of that animal... or maybe an arm tree. You never really know.

When all things are possible, the question of whether something has been done is just a question of time and how imaginative the population is. That brings to mind the problem of [a single author](#a-single-author) as well.

- literal anthropomorphization of prepared food
  - cakes covered in moving tendrils
  - cheese with eyes
  - strawberries with butterfly wings
  - creme brule that grows
- mixing of biological kingdoms
  - animals that grow as vegetables
  - vegetables that move and eat each other like animals
  - fungi and insects to add characteristics to things

### Effects

I think I might be making a horror world. I don't want it to be body horror. I want it to be very matter of fact, "this is just how it is here". I feel like we treat animals that way in our own world, and I want a kind of gross alien juxtaposition, but with humans still in the forefront. It shouldn't be gross after getting used to it though (butter noodles). It's the same way you have to come to terms with the meat industry: that life feeds on death.

How do you find the tasteful things in a strange world? What would artisans and chefs do with these ingredients? What would industry do?

## A Single Author

I am but a single author making an entire world. I am using all the help I can get, but the elephant in the room is that there is a "hive mind", a "local god", that is orchestrating everything. No one can know about or talk to this hive mind, but it controls everything. How do you address that?

The dragon disguised as an old beggar? No, more like a beholder disguised as an old beggar.

### Black Powder

These themes come into play with the "black powder", a perversion of the light stones. The stones, or their precursors, are ground and processed for nefarious purposes, namely to produce this addictive drug. It allows a "hive mind" where once there was none. Or do they just reveal that there *is* actually a hive mind, the author, who rules the fate of roleplay existence?

Lesser minds feel themselves and their sorrows wash away briefly into the power and confidence of a collective. The powerful feel themselves running the hive at the helm with the other powerful "board members". It gives everyone their perfect role in the collective in exchange for their identity. Everyone has value, everyone feels appreciated and fulfilled. Everyone does what they're good at, and often finds out what that is.

Using the powder slowly integrates you more and more with the "hive". The group of others also using the powder. It places everyone's mind into a sort of "central will" where you lose your sense of self to the group's sense of self. Powerfully willed individuals often feel they can control the flow of the group, and are triggered to interact with it more often. But it removes their identity just a much, and uses their ideas and determination to fuel it's own ends. This is assimilation into "the borg" or "the Q collective" from Star Trek: Next Generation, but in a voluntary drug.

It's main fault is that as it adds to it's collective, it removes the distinctiveness that produced the things desirable for the collective will in the first place. The collective needs food the same as the individual, but **the food of the collective is individuality itself**.

Is that bad? I suppose I designed it to be, but maybe it's something worthwhile, just misunderstood.

### The Infection

The foil to this that frames it in a biological light is the fungal zombie infection. Like the fungus that takes over the minds of ants, it takes over dead bodies of animals (maybe a little before they die), and adds them to it's own collective, spreading itself using spores through the blood. They communicate and see silently with pheromone signals like how a bee hive or an ant colony operates.

Unlike the powder, the fungus truly just kills you. It doesn't add anything more than your corpse to the collective, though in some circumstances it leaves your vitals **and** your mind alive enough for you to go on living, but with a new "subconscious smell" of the hive. You can then interact and communicate with the hive, though you only feel it's mind as a "very specific urge or craving" to do what the hive commands.
