# Roleplay

## 2023-11-12

Been a while. I haven't read the log yet. Going to give it a quick once over and come back.

There is a lot of depth here. I often write those lofty passages and think "man, this is stupid. who's going to read this and actually get anything out of it other than 'what a pretentious asshole?'"

But in trying to be honest, a lot of that is made ok. Language is a filter. The barriers to entry are really just signals we look to identify with. People give off certain symbols as they try to exist and find their moment. We may not be receptive to that as we seek our own, but be authentic anyway.

### Practicalities

I'm tired of conceptual masturbation. It's time for some *REAL* masturbation! I need to write a D&D campaign. Or a roleplaying campaign of some kind. This needs to be episodic in nature, have a entry and exit point, and follow a core cast of characters bound together for some reason.

I need to make it in advance. I can tweak it on the fly, and maybe bring people out of the world, but I need to be ready for them with something to say when they come. It can't be mean or harsh, but it needs to be personal and real. Can't it? Does it?

### Episode 0 - The Lighthouse

Need to start at the start.

Is it magic or a trick? The child accepts while the adult rejects. But technology is magic. Science is magic. Magic is life from a perspective of wonder at the unknown intricacies of the world.

What if you are being tricked? Isn't that the second half of magic? Learning the *tricks* of the trade?

What makes us lose that as we age. I think we all may be too jaded for our own good. Even the best of us die a little every day on the inside as we accept the things we must do over the things we would like to. As a child we reject that, and they are not tricks. They are dark truths of the world: chores, bosses, and paychecks.

So now we reject instead those things that once gave us happiness for what we now see as our only options? Settling. That is settling.

I am a type of person that would like to look back and try to bring that magic with me. I feel I have lost it, and I must bring it back. If I can bring it back for myself. If I can somehow spawn a well of magic from my efforts that the good hearted may be able to find from anywhere and partake of, then I will call my mission complete, and everything else icing on the cake.

But that is a lofty, "magical" goal, that I may *hope* for, but I feel it may never truly be realized. That's ok. It is a noble goal, and worth the journey. It will make me a better person I hope, and inspire others to follow those same lofty dreams. Isn't that the beginnings of the effects to be found?

The people of the plants. A peacful utopia, threatened by "the consumers". "The deficient". "Those who can not grow". "The half-beings" or "halflings". It is tounge and cheek for a human to call one's self a "halfling" in the presence of the plant people.

There is no redemption arc here. This is a drama, not a comedy. It is the story of humanity's demise at the hands of a benevolent judge. Even those who feel they are righteous are murderers by their very nature.

This is an attempt to make my first "adaptive" story. Filled with characters and loops, the way Stardew Valley is.

But it will be a chat-based adventure I think. A group chat like from the days of AIM, but for the youth of today. Touching on the nostalgia and the cringe alike.

I have recently discovered the anime "Kaiba" and it has quickly become one of my favorite. It is essentially the exact setting and technology I imagined for the "cloning" capabilities of my own world.

The data-based "memory" aspect seems a little thin. Jellyfish and others have been shown to exist with multiple or no brains, distributed muscle memory running their daily cycles.

Something more like [Sparse Associative Memory]() that you see arise out of neural networks is how I imagine memory to work. To transfer would be like transplanting an arm, but a chunk of brain thread.

### The Brain

I imagine the brain as a network of neural "threads". These are woven together in loops, tangles, and knots, firing and working off of each other like a tapestry.

Classifying, weaving, changing the weave of this tapestry is akin to the manipulation of the conscious mind. Changing memory, but also personality and genetics. Predisposed to disease or choices of one type or another. Prone to one job type, relationship, or location. A series of historical interplays between biology, chance, and the intervention of self and others.

A grafter of plants does something similar. What is life when you can cut a branch off a tree, and grow another tree from it? Are animals so exclusively unique?

### Biology as Computer

The creator of the universe uses it as a Docker container. Life is spawned to accomplish some goal, like Lemmings, life is a swarm of agents converting one thing to another and multiplying to do that everywhere it can.

Programs are made using predators and prey. Feedback loops are encouraged or broken, both in the positive and negative directions, to move the system along one path or another.

To maintain continuity, control must be managed at scale. Larger scales are fine to manage on basic rules, but more densely evolving areas, like where there is life, must be resolved in finer detail. Quantum properties ensure that only what is necessary is resolved, and all possibilities are entertained, saving computational load, but relativity is used to maintain continuity of perspective.

Each agent is really a perspective and a few other things, like personality and preference. Build and reputation. Characters grow over time, becoming legacy codebases in their own right.

The results are used a level up, in the world of the creators, high on "Mt. Olympus" as it were. Where they observe and control what they can, hidden until they want to be seen. Food

It is this place that is considered desireable, as all high places are, by most of those those below it. The parable of the family that lives in a vinegar jug comes to mind.
