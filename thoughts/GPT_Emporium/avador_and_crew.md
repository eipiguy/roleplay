# **Avador's Intent**

## **Authority**

Avador holds ultimate authority on the ship. His First Mate Imara is his right hand, and they work together to make key decisions. The chief engineer, Roran, has significant influence over the ship's operations.

## **Rules and Regulations**

The ship operates on a charter established by Avador, which emphasizes freedom, respect, and non-aggression. Crew members and passengers alike are expected to respect these guidelines. Violence is discouraged, and disputes are settled through arbitration.

## **Roles and Jobs**

The ship requires various roles to function effectively. These include navigators, engineers, maintenance crew, security personnel, medical staff, cooks, and many more. The hierarchy is relatively flat, with Avador, Imara, and Roran at the top, followed by various team leads and then the crew.

## **Power Dynamics**

Unofficially, the shopkeepers and service providers form a collective that can influence the ship's economy. They don't have authority over the ship's operations, but their cooperation is essential for smooth sailing.

# **Passengers and Shops:**

## **Representative Factions**

### Characters

1. **Zael**: A representative from the Dragon faction who runs a black-market operation dealing in light stones. He is a cunning businessman and always seems to have a stash of light stones that aren't regulated by the government.

2. **Dr. Elia**: A human biologist who's been exiled from the mainland due to her 'unorthodox' experiments. She runs a small medical clinic and laboratory on the ship, providing healthcare services to the passengers and crew while also continuing her research into the fungal infection. She represents the Wizards faction.

3. **Ferris**: A fervent follower of the Church of Fermentation who runs a brewery on the ship. His establishment serves as a gathering place for like-minded individuals who seek to 'distill' rather than expand.

4. **Glim**: One of the "gnomes", who runs a shop selling finely-crafted items of clothing and exquisite jewelry. He is seen as eccentric by many of the passengers, but his charming, gnome-like demeanor and his knack for going unnoticed make him a good source of information.

### Integration

1. **Economic Contribution and Influence**: The faction representatives have their own shops or services that contribute to the ship's economy. Zael's light stone trade, Dr. Elia's clinic and lab, Ferris's brewery, and Glim's shop all provide essential goods and services. Their actions can directly impact the economy of the ship, and their decisions can affect the daily lives of the passengers.

2. **Unique Skills and Abilities**: Each representative possesses unique skills and knowledge that make them valuable. Zael has insider knowledge about light stones, Dr. Elia is a skilled biologist, Ferris is an expert brewer and charismatic preacher, and Glim has a knack for going unnoticed and procuring rare items.

3. **Engaging with Players**: The NPCs can engage with the players based on their individual needs and interests. Zael can provide light stones or insider information, Dr. Elia can offer medical services or quests related to her research, Ferris can offer unique brews or an alliance with the Church, and Glim can provide valuable items or information.

4. **Adapting to Players' Needs**: The NPCs can modify their approach based on the players' needs. If a particular interaction doesn't work out, they can offer alternative solutions or introduce the players to other faction members. They can grow alongside the players, adjusting their support and collaboration based on the players' changing needs.

# **Events Leading to Current Mission:**

The event that triggers the ship's departure could be a sudden increase in the spread of the fungal infection within the pocket dimension. This leads to panic among the government and the factions, with each party blaming the others for the outbreak. Amid the chaos, the government hastily grants Captain Avador a license to leave the pocket dimension and seek help or a cure from the outside world. This decision is met with opposition from various factions, leading to increased tension on the ship as they set sail into the unknown. 

The representative NPCs from each faction, while initially onboard for their own reasons, find themselves caught up in the ship's mission. They become key figures in navigating the ship's internal politics and the external threats they face, offering potential allies or adversaries for the players.

## **Unaffiliated Passenger Factions**

1. **The Dockside Merchants**: Occupying the vicinity of the ship's docks, these are families involved in trading, who have their roots in seafaring and exploration. They value adventure, discovery, and trade. They work closely with the crew for loading and unloading cargo and they keep a harmonious relationship with other factions.

2. **The Steam Quarter Engineers**: These are the families of artisans, blacksmiths, and tinkerers residing near the engine rooms. They value hard work, creativity, and innovation. They maintain the ship's mechanical parts and often have a contentious relationship with the ship's magical workers.

3. **The Lantern Ward Sages**: Near the ship's library and research rooms, these families consist of scholars, teachers, and students who value knowledge and wisdom. They are involved in studying the different realms the ship visits and offer their services as advisors to the crew and other factions.

## **Passenger Economy and Survival**

Passengers make money through various means like running shops, providing services, or trading goods. Some are involved in specialized professions like magical artifact appraisal, inter-dimensional cartography, or arcane engineering. They have a self-contained economy with trade occurring within the ship and occasionally with external entities.

Essential needs are met through a variety of unique stores and markets selling everything from magical ingredients to everyday commodities. There's a bustling market selling fuel gems for magical cooking and heat. Materials for construction and maintenance are obtained from a combination of onboard production and external trade. There are numerous small shops offering a variety of goods and services, from magical trinkets to tailoring. Entertainment venues like the Illusory Theater or the Gnome-run Mirth Tavern cater to diverse interests.

## **Passenger Dynamics**

Passenger relationships and power dynamics significantly influence the ship's social environment. The three neighborhood factions each have their own sphere of influence. The Dockside Merchants have a say in trade, the Steam Quarter Engineers in ship maintenance, and the Lantern Ward Sages in research and education. This creates a balanced system, though conflicts do arise, usually resolved through negotiation or arbitration.

# **Motivations for Shanghaiing**

The motivations vary. Some seek specific skills or professions not available onboard. Some might forcibly transport individuals to protect them from dangers in their home realms. Others might have hidden agendas requiring particular individuals, such as someone with a rare magical talent. External factors like new realm exploration mandates from the governing factions might necessitate new recruits.

**Shanghaiing Methods**

Methods vary depending on who is involved. The persuasive might use charm or negotiation, while the more ruthless might employ intimidation or deception. Some use magical means like illusions or enchantments, and teleportation is the usual method of transportation.

**Consequences**

Being shanghaied is a disorienting and often traumatic experience. Some might resist, leading to conflict with their captors, while others might adapt and find a place in the ship's society. Their backgrounds and skills can create new storylines and conflicts, providing rich fodder for the campaign.
