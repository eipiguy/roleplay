In a world where transport is as simple as stepping into a beam of light, the heart of the economy thrives on the production of Light Stones, mystical orbs that enable this wondrous travel. The key ingredients are common dragon glass and the pearl from an elusive breed of oyster, only found in the most hidden corners of the world. 

While the obsidian is easily obtained, the pearl is a treasure beyond measure. Many have sought to replicate it, with results ranging from utter failure to rumored success, but the truth remains shrouded in mystery. 

You live in an age where the secret to crafting these Light Stones has been made public by a pair of eccentric researchers. Their discovery has opened up endless possibilities, and with it, new adventures.

Enter Avador, a tinkerer and explorer at heart. He captains a colossal airship, a floating marketplace bustling with magical oddities and curiosities. His ship is one of the few licensed to travel beyond the boundaries of your known world, venturing into the unexplored cosmos in search of the elusive oyster and the secrets of light travel. 

As the ship descends upon your town, it feels like a blend of fantastical Diagon Alley and the Weasley's magical toy shop, brought to you on the wings of a colossal airship. It's a sight to behold, filled with a crew of colorful characters, each with their own stories and quests. 

But beware: this isn't just a vessel of trade and exploration. It's a ship known for whisking away those who get too close, embarking them on adventures they never dreamed of, whether they signed up for them or not.

While this marvel of the skies offers a chance for adventure, an insidious threat plagues your world. An infection has broken out, transforming the afflicted into the living dead, their minds overtaken by a strange fungus. Yet, for some, this infection becomes a perverse form of immortality. 

A cult has formed, seeking to harness the infection's power and achieve eternal life. Their practices are dangerous and fraught with peril, often leading to disastrous consequences.

In this world of magical travel, sky-high adventure, and undead horror, your journey is about to begin. Will you seize the opportunity to explore the unknown, or will you fight to protect your world from the spreading plague? The choice is yours. 

Welcome to the Sky Mall. Your adventure awaits.
