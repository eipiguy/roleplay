**1. Dragons' Response to Power Loss**

The dragons, upon the public release of the lightstone manufacturing recipe, see their influence on the island dwindling. To regain some of their power, they lean into their ancient wisdom and knowledge, positioning themselves as the keepers of lore and advisors to the city leaders and powerful factions across the island.

*Player Involvement*: After being introduced to the concept of dragons and their shifting role on Avador's ship, the players might be entrusted with a dragon egg to deliver to a city on the island, or they could be asked to negotiate a peace treaty between a dragon and a city that's in conflict, serving as a testament to the dragons' new roles as advisors and peacekeepers.

**2. Wizards' Schism and Balance Shift**

The public availability of the pearl recipe causes a split among the wizards on the island, with the biologist wizards feeling their specialized skills have been invalidated. The non-biologist wizards, on the other hand, revel in their newfound ability to create lightstones, leading to a power shift and growing tension.

*Player Involvement*: During their time on Avador's ship, the players learn about the tensions between the two factions of wizards. Once on the island, they might find themselves mediating disputes between the factions, or they might be recruited to help one side gain an advantage over the other.

**3. The Cult of Fermentation and the Democratization of Power**

The Cult of Fermentation, based in one of the island's cities, develops a brew that grants temporary magical abilities. This brew is seen as a means of democratizing power but also threatens to destabilize the existing order.

*Player Involvement*: The players might first hear rumors of this brew while on Avador's ship. Once they reach the island, they could be tasked with securing a batch of the brew, regulating its distribution, or dealing with the consequences of its misuse.

**4. Infection Crisis and the Role of the Cult**

The zombie infection is a widespread crisis on the island, affecting all cities and factions. The Cult of Fermentation, with their unique knowledge of the infection, can either be a potential ally in the fight against the infection or a dangerous wild card.

*Player Involvement*: The players first learn about the infection on Avador's ship, perhaps even encountering an infected person. Once on the island, they might be tasked with finding a cure, negotiating with the Cult for their help, or investigating whether the Cult is inadvertently spreading the infection.

This version of the arcs keeps the factions and the key conflicts intact while shifting the setting from Avador's ship to the island where the bulk of the campaign will take place. The ship serves as a training ground and introduction to these elements, but the real action happens once the players reach the island.
