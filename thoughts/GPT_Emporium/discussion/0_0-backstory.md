# The Setting

In this world there is an economy built around "light travel", and almost everything is a search for the components used to make the travel stones:
- Simple obsidian, or "dragon glass", is the main component, but it is easily obtained by access to a dragon (willing or forced) and a specific stone that is powderized. This stone ingredient is so often sourced as sand that people have forgotten they can use the raw stone as well.
- Pearls from a specially bred oyster, fed a secret proprietary diet, is the difficult to find/reproduce component, as it requires skilled magical biologists, and specific large scale environments to breed and harvest the oysters.

Once produced, these ingredients are combined with blends of other trace components for different purposes (distance, range of field, penetration, etc...), powdered in giant grinders, melted together in giant magical furnaces, and then blown into perfect spheres with the aid of anti-gravity magic (a key component of the trained technical labor needed). Many have tried to find or reproduce the oyster's pearls needed for the light stones, often with disastrous results. [include some stories about well known failed attempts] Others claim to have already done so, but keep the secret under lock and key in hopes of beating everyone to the elusive "earth passing" stone.

Our story begins after the public release of a recipe for their manufacture that can be performed in a common wizards shop, bundled with the needed antigravity spellwork that is often to hard to formulate. These were made by a team of researchers: a mad biologist who engineered and bred the oysters, but has now made another experiment that escaped and ravages the countryside (the infection), and a former business tycoon who "found GOD" when planeswalking to other worlds and has since left to never be seen again.

The biologist is quarantined on a small island off the coast of a larger main island that is the center of the campaign. These islands are the only known landmasses in the endless ocean of the pocket universe. She continues to search for a cure to the infection, as well as work towards a better, more "complete" light network. Those purposes have consumed her and they have taken on more and more meaning the longer she lives in isolation. She is beginning to understand the planeswalker who was intellectually isolated and understood the underpinning mechanisms of the universe. She is very close to becoming a planeswalker herself.

# Avador On the Search

Avador is a contracted explorer on the search for new species of oyster for this biologist. He is also always looking for other signs of networked teleportation devices that can be used by lay people. Like everyone else, he want to make the next big thing.

He is a tinkerer and an explorer at heart. He hates the government, but also hates the opposition factions. He's bad at delegating and playing politics, so he generally stays out of it. He circumvents the system (along with a few other licensed "private explorer companies") with a do-it-yourself attitude, and a giant lighthouse ship with a small city block worth of shops and people. It is capable of physically travelling outside the pocket dimension that makes up the campaign world. (The only current limit of the light network besides earth travel.)

Their ship is given license to leave the pocket because the island's government wants to build networks outside their known bubble, and is slowly anchoring new mass transport stones in the nearest fringes. This is attempted to be kept low key, but promising talent is always welcome.

# Motivations

The characters should be presented with the airship arriving in dramatic fashion, and selling all sorts of magical wares. Think a magical kitchen kaboodle version of Diagon Alley or the Weasley's toyshop from Harry Potter slapped on the top of a massive air-ship.

The characters are presented with different characters on the ship that represent parts of the crew, designed to appeal to different motivations aboard the ship and to encourage travel (potentially forever, and unwillingly) to a new and alien world... maybe with their other friends or family?

They shanghai people!

# The Infection

Back in the campaign world there is a zombie infection. It is passed by blood exposure: broken skin normally means infection. It kills you in an hour, coagulating your blood like snake venom. After death, everyone regains their animated senses as a zombie. Only 1/20 that are infected regain their control though; the rest essetially die standing. It seems their brains are infected by a fungus that propels them to attack and infect others against their will.

Bodies are physically dead and begin to decay, but they seem to move devoid of their injuries, down to being animated skeletons covered in mycelia. The infected retain sense of their skin as it decays, their sight and lack of it as their eyeballs rot.

The 1/20 that remain in control are essentially immortal, but are often overcome with strong urges to bite or claw at other living things, and are drawn to the smell of CO2, even without a nose (from the fungus).

This infection was a result of an immortality experiment by the (now "quarantined") mad biologist that escaped from its research compound's containment.

This biologist is one of the partners in the original invention of the light stones used for the light transportation network.

## The Fermentation Cult

A cult of "living mummification" has popped up in recent times that attempts to preserve and infect a living participant for this transformation. These "churches" take over trap houses across the continent and attempt to take a group of preferably willing participants into immortality or living death. Quite high stakes, so the very desperate are the main demographic. They are promised a swift death if the process fails, but are commonly unaware that their dismembered pieces remain conscious as well after conversion. Often immolation is the only relief.

These events are centered around an invention that seems to isolate the infection to a particular body part. These "rebel bands" are distributed in response to a civilian infection, but have been found to be useful in other nefarious circumstances. They are a common black market currency when money is not usable.

These church groups infect each other and then simultaneously remove bands to let the infection take hold and die while tied down. They are convinced a "survivor" will emerge to collect the rest, and at worst give them a swift death. This is essentially group suicide and should be treated carefully by the dm and characters. Think of alternatives or ways of softening?

Against all preparation, this almost always ends as an accidentally released zombie agent infecting a town. A group of 20 is required for the churches, but these are hard to obtain. Many are forced to participate unwillingly. The number is so that on average a single leader will emerge to further the cause. They do not have to fight others for control, but are gifted immortality. They often are ruthless enough to use the other zombies to their own ends rather than give them a swift death.
