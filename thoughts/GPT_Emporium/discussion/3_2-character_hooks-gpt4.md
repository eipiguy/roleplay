Here are expanded descriptions for these NPCs and ways they can connect the players to the plots of their respective factions:

1. **Zael**: Zael is a dragon-born businessman with a cool demeanor and a sharp mind for trade. As a representative of the Dragon faction, he operates a black-market light stone operation on Avador's ship. He always seems to have a stash of unregulated light stones and is adept at avoiding the authorities. Zael, however, knows the old ways are changing and seeks to reposition his people as indispensable sources of wisdom and knowledge. He could be a potential contact for the players when they need to get in touch with the dragon faction on the island. 

   *Plot Hook*: Zael could approach the players with a proposition to deliver a dragon egg to a specific location on the island. The egg could be a peace offering, symbolizing the Dragons' new roles as advisors and peacekeepers.

2. **Dr. Elia**: Dr. Elia is a human biologist who was exiled from the mainland due to her unorthodox experiments. Despite this, she continues her work aboard Avador's ship, running a small medical clinic and laboratory. Her focus is on finding a cure for the fungal infection plaguing the island, and she's not afraid to push the boundaries of ethical magic use. As a representative of the Wizards faction, her work and expertise could be invaluable to the players.

   *Plot Hook*: Dr. Elia might ask the players to procure a rare ingredient for her research, or she might provide them with crucial information on the schism between the two wizard factions on the island.

3. **Ferris**: Ferris is a passionate follower of the Church of Fermentation who runs a brewery on the ship. His establishment is a hub for those who seek to distill power rather than expand it. As a representative of the Cult, Ferris is a true believer in the democratization of power and could introduce the players to the concept of the magical brew that grants temporary powers. 

   *Plot Hook*: Once the players arrive on the island, Ferris could contact them with a request to help him secure a batch of the magical brew from the Cult's headquarters. Alternatively, he might need the players' help to moderate the effects of a misuse of the brew.

4. **Glim**: Glim is a gnome shopkeeper aboard Avador's ship, selling beautifully crafted clothes and jewelry. He is known for his eccentric and charming demeanor. Although he may seem like a simple merchant, his knack for going unnoticed and his extensive network of contacts make him an excellent source of information. 

   *Plot Hook*: Glim could provide the players with valuable intelligence about the spread of the fungal infection on the island. Alternatively, he might have information on the Cult's activities or the tensions between the wizard factions. His information could prove crucial in navigating the island's political landscape.

These NPCs can act as catalysts for the players' involvement in the island's faction politics, providing them with valuable contacts and resources. They also provide a link back to Avador's ship, ensuring that the experiences and lessons from session zero continue to impact the campaign.

Here are some additional quest and interaction ideas for each of these characters:

1. **Zael**:
   - *Dragon Festival*: Zael invites the players to a Dragon Festival, a traditional event where dragons and dragon-born display their strength and wisdom. The festival could serve as a setting for the players to learn more about the Dragon faction's history, culture, and their new role in the changing political landscape. In the midst of the festival, Zael might ask the players to assist in resolving a dispute that threatens the peace, further emphasizing the Dragons' new role as mediators.
   - *Trading Negotiation*: Zael needs help in negotiating a trade deal with a group of rival black-market traders. He believes the players, as outsiders, could offer a fresh perspective and help facilitate a fair deal. This could give the players insight into the intricacies of the light stone trade and how the Dragon faction is trying to maintain its influence.

2. **Dr. Elia**:
   - *Lab Assistant*: Dr. Elia offers the players a chance to assist her in her lab. This could involve anything from helping her with an experiment, to gathering data or monitoring the progress of a test subject. This would allow the players to see first-hand the effects of the fungal infection and the efforts being made to find a cure.
   - *Bio-Magic Class*: Dr. Elia organizes a Bio-Magic class for those interested in the blend of biology and wizardry. Participating in this class could help players understand the schism between the wizards and the impact of the new, public, pearl recipe on the magical community.

3. **Ferris**:
   - *Brewing Contest*: Ferris holds a brewing contest aboard the ship. Participants are invited to create their own magical brews, with the best one earning a special prize. This could be an opportunity for the players to experiment with the magical brews and gain first-hand experience of their effects.
   - *Tasting Night*: Ferris invites the players to a special Tasting Night at his brewery, where they get to sample different magical brews. This could serve as a fun and engaging way for the players to learn more about the Cult and their beliefs.

4. **Glim**:
   - *Fashion Show*: Glim organizes a fashion show featuring his latest creations. The players could be invited as special guests, or even asked to participate as models. During the event, Glim could share information about the factions on the island, and how the changing political landscape is affecting everyone, not just the powerful and influential.
   - *Scavenger Hunt*: Glim sets up a scavenger hunt around the ship, promising a valuable reward to the winner. This fun event could also serve as a way for Glim to share information with the players, with each clue leading them to a piece of information about the island's factions.

These quests and interactions not only allow for more detailed exploration of each NPC's character, but they also provide the players with varied and engaging ways to learn about the factions and the broader political landscape of the campaign world.
