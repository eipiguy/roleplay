After reflecting on the initial brainstorming session, these are the next steps I can think of in filling out the character's and their arcs.

Some things I would like to consider:
- What am I missing?
- Meta planning. How could I make a system to design and plan effectively for each session?
	- Minimal but important prep work
	- Adaptability: handle things going sideways

# Avador's Intent and Crew

Avador is the captain, but the passengers are the majority of the ship's population/economy.
- How do they make money? Are they pirates? Traders? Transportation?
- Who maintains order and how?
- What rules do people follow?
- What are the jobs/roles needed to crew the ship? How many people, and what is the hierarchy?
	- Cargo airplane
	- Ocean liner cargo ship
	- Aircraft carrier
	- Submarine
	- The International Space Station
- What about unofficial power dynamics between the employee teams?

# Passengers and Their Crews

Since the passengers are the majority of the ship, they must have their own internal politics, relationships, and power dynamics.

What are they? How do they make money? What do people need to survive in a self-contained environment?

Potentials:
- Strange grocery stores or magical markets
- Fuel? Magical cooking methods or needs?
- Building materials for shelter
- Magical mom and pop shops? Traders?
- Entertainment?

## Passenger Interactions

- Set the tone and power dynamics of the group
- Plot hooks that help determine who the protagonists and antagonists in the setting are

## What is the main quest? Whose side do the characters take?

The session zero needs a representative from each faction that gives the players an in for that narrative as a setting upon landing in the isekai. Whoever the players follow, if any, should serve as their allies, and the natural adversaries based on factional motivations will follow.

Who are these key potential allies? What about if their interactions with the characters don't pan out, but they still seem interested in their cause? How do I re-make the allies to accommodate?

# Double Check

- Plot holes? Is the economy realistic?
- Anything too contrived or too subtle?
- How do you stay adaptable and give everyone room to breathe and have fun?
