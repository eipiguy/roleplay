# Meta-Prompt Exploration

Hello there. I am a dungeon master for a small group of players, and I am trying to flesh out my campaign from a framework I have run once before. To start I would like to make a session zero that I can use to test the way I design sessions for the campaign. A sort of "meta planning" if you will.

I would like to copy and paste in a couple markdown files for you to read: first a general summary of the setting, and then some initial thoughts that I've come to about how I want to approach a "session zero" in that setting

Could you please wait for me to upload this information? I then have some topics I'd like to discuss if you are willing.

## Meta Planning

After reflecting on the initial brainstorming session, there are the next steps I can think of in filling out the character's and their arcs. I will discuss those shortly.

But before that, some things I would like to consider:
- What am I missing? I am trying to cover my bases, but I feel like I will always miss something. Plot holes or character needs, or things I'm unaware of.
- Meta planning. How could I make a system to design and plan effectively for each session?
	- Minimal but important prep work
	- Adaptability: handle things going sideways

# Next Steps

# Avador's Intent and Crew

I would like to flesh out Avador and his ship's framework a little more. Avador is the captain, but the passengers are the majority of the ship's population/economy.

I have the following questions about that. Could you help me refine the questions to be more pertinent, informational, or realistic?

These questions are as follows:
- How do they make money? Are they pirates? Traders? Transportation?
- Who maintains order and how?
- What rules do people follow?
- What are the jobs/roles needed to crew the massive city block's worth of people and space on an air/space ship? How many people, and what is the hierarchy?
	- Cargo airplane
	- Ocean liner cargo ship
	- Aircraft carrier
	- Submarine
	- The International Space Station
	- The starship Enterprise
- What about unofficial power dynamics between the employee teams?

## Refined Questions

Certainly! Here are refined versions of your questions about Avador, his ship, and the framework surrounding them:

1. How does Avador and his crew generate income? Are they primarily involved in piracy, trade, transportation, or a combination of these activities?

2. In maintaining order on the ship, who holds authority and enforces rules? Is there a specific leadership structure or governing body, or is it a more decentralized system?

3. What rules and regulations do people on the ship follow? Are there specific codes of conduct, laws, or guidelines that govern their behavior, both towards each other and towards passengers or clients?

4. What are the different jobs and roles required to crew a massive air/space ship of this size, equivalent to a city block? How many people are needed to run the ship effectively, and what is the hierarchy or chain of command among the crew members? Drawing inspiration from the following examples, consider the scale of personnel and roles required:
   - Cargo airplane
   - Ocean liner cargo ship
   - Aircraft carrier
   - Submarine
   - The International Space Station
   - The starship Enterprise

5. Apart from the official hierarchy and roles, are there any unofficial power dynamics among different employee teams or groups on the ship? How do these dynamics influence decision-making, relationships, and interactions among the crew members?

By considering and answering these refined questions, you can further develop the details and dynamics of Avador's ship, its operations, and the social structure within. This will provide a more comprehensive and realistic framework for your campaign.

If you need any further assistance or have additional questions, feel free to let me know!

# Passengers and Their Crews

Since the passengers are the majority of the ship, they must have their own internal politics, relationships, and power dynamics.

I need to flesh out who they are in a way that makes them appealing to the characters. I have some potential questions and ideas about them I would also like you to refine. How would I ask these questions in a more succinct way, and what other questions could I ask to give the economy and dynamics of the ship some level of realize and immersion? Are my ideas on the right track, and what else might I draw inspiration from?

- What are the "neighborhood factions"?
- How do they make money?
- What do people need to survive in a self-contained environment in general? Some Potentials:
	- Strange grocery stores or magical markets
	- Fuel? Magical cooking methods or needs?
	- Building materials for shelter
	- Magical mom and pop shops? Traders?
	- Entertainment?

## Response

Certainly! Here are refined versions of your questions and ideas about the passengers on Avador's ship:

1. What are the distinct "neighborhood factions" among the passengers? How do these factions form, and what are their goals, values, or interests? How do they interact with each other and the crew?

2. How do the passengers on the ship make money or sustain themselves economically? Are there specific industries or trades within the passenger community? Do they engage in trade with other factions or external entities?

3. Besides earning money, what are the essential needs for survival in the self-contained environment of the ship? Consider the following potential aspects:
   - Unique grocery stores or magical markets that provide specialized or rare ingredients.
   - Fuel requirements or specific magical cooking methods that sustain the passengers' food preparation.
   - Availability of building materials for constructing and maintaining shelter or accommodations within the ship.
   - Existence of magical mom-and-pop shops or traders who offer unique services or goods.
   - Provision of entertainment options or venues that cater to the diverse interests of the passengers.

4. How do relationships and power dynamics among the passengers influence the ship's dynamics and daily life? Are there social hierarchies, cliques, or alliances within the passenger community? How do these dynamics impact decision-making, interactions, and conflicts?

5. What sources of inspiration can you draw from to create a more realistic and immersive economy and dynamics on the ship? Consider looking into real-world examples of communal living, such as intentional communities, co-living spaces, or unique social structures within closed environments. You can also draw inspiration from science fiction literature or other media that explore similar concepts.

By exploring these refined questions and ideas, you can develop a more intricate and immersive world for the passengers on Avador's ship. It will help create a diverse and engaging community that appeals to the characters and provides opportunities for roleplaying, decision-making, and character development.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to let me know!

# Refining for Unwilling Participants

Certainly! Based on the context of the world you provided, here are some questions that can help you flesh out the reasons why the ship and its crew or passengers might "shanghai" someone:

1. What are the motivations or incentives for the ship's crew or passengers to forcibly recruit or transport individuals into the campaign world? Consider the following possibilities:
   - Are there specific skills or abilities that the crew or passengers seek in potential recruits?
   - Is there a shortage of certain roles or professions on the ship, and do they actively seek to fill those gaps?
   - Do they shanghai individuals for their own safety, protecting them from external threats or dangerous circumstances?
   - Are there secrets or hidden agendas among the crew or passengers that require them to recruit specific individuals?

2. Are there external pressures or factors that push the ship's crew or passengers to forcefully bring people into the campaign world? Consider the following scenarios:
   - Are there external authorities or factions that impose regulations or quotas on the ship, necessitating the acquisition of new personnel?
   - Are there economic incentives or benefits associated with recruiting individuals, such as rewards or privileges granted by certain factions or organizations?

3. How do the crew or passengers go about the act of shanghaiing? What methods or techniques do they employ? Consider the following possibilities:
   - Are there individuals within the crew or passengers who specialize in persuasion, manipulation, or coercion to convince or trick people into joining?
   - Do they rely on physical force or intimidation to ensure compliance?
   - Are there magical or technological means that facilitate the shanghaiing process, such as illusions, mind control, or teleportation?

4. What are the consequences or aftermath of being shanghaied into the campaign world? How do the characters react to this experience? Consider the following aspects:
   - Are there opportunities for the characters to resist or escape their forced recruitment and potentially become allies or adversaries of the crew or passengers?
   - How do the characters' backgrounds, skills, or personal goals align with or conflict with the ship's objectives, creating potential storylines or conflicts?

By exploring these questions, you can delve deeper into the reasons behind the shanghaiing and its impact on the characters and the overall narrative. It adds complexity and potential sources of tension or intrigue within the campaign.

# Representative NPCs

I'm also trying to set up some sub-plots or characters that serve as introductions to the factions the players could take part in. Could you helps me refine a list of questions I could ask to try and flesh out who they might be and how I could construct them?

So far I am thinking of the following as a starting point:

The session zero needs a representative from each faction that gives the players an in for that narrative as a setting upon landing in the isekai. Whoever the players follow, if any, should serve as their allies, and the natural adversaries based on factional motivations will follow.

Who are these key potential allies? What about if their interactions with the characters don't pan out, but they still seem interested in their cause? How do I re-make the allies to accommodate?

## Response

Certainly! Here's a refined list of questions to help you flesh out the key potential allies representing each faction and their interactions with the characters:

1. Who are the key potential allies from each faction that serve as introductions to the narrative of the respective faction? Consider the following aspects:
   - Their background and role within the faction: Are they leaders, prominent members, or influential figures?
   - Their motivations and goals: What drives them to align with the faction's cause?
   - Their relationship with the faction: How do they fit into the faction's hierarchy or structure?

2. How do these potential allies initially interact with the characters in the session zero? Consider the following possibilities:
   - Do they approach the characters directly, recognizing their potential or unique qualities?
   - Are there specific tasks or missions they assign to the characters to gauge their abilities and commitment?
   - Do they offer information or resources to help the characters understand the faction's cause and engage with it?

3. If the characters' interactions with the potential allies don't pan out initially but they still show interest in the faction's cause, how can you accommodate their continued involvement? Consider the following options:
   - Introduce alternative representatives or lower-ranking members of the faction who may have different perspectives or approaches.
   - Provide opportunities for the characters to prove their dedication or demonstrate their skills to the faction, thus gaining the attention and trust of other faction members.
   - Create scenarios where the characters' paths intersect with the faction's activities or conflicts, allowing them to contribute and earn the faction's respect.

4. How do the potential allies' motivations, goals, and personalities align or conflict with the characters' own objectives? Consider the following factors:
   - Are there shared interests or common enemies that naturally align the potential allies with the characters?
   - Are there ideological differences or conflicting agendas that may create tensions or challenges in their alliance?
   - How can the potential allies evolve and grow alongside the characters, providing opportunities for character development and meaningful relationships?

By considering these questions, you can create well-rounded potential allies representing each faction, allowing the players to choose their allies based on their interactions and interests. Additionally, by accommodating the characters' continued involvement with the faction even if their initial interactions don't pan out, you provide flexibility and opportunities for the narrative to adapt and evolve.

   - How can the NPCs serve as mentors, allies, or potential partners for the players, fostering deeper relationships and narrative connections?

4. In what ways can the representative NPCs adapt to the players' needs and intents if their initial interactions don't pan out as expected? Consider the following options:
   - Can the NPCs modify their approach or offer alternative solutions to accommodate the players' interests or preferences?
   - Are there additional faction members or factions within the ship that the NPCs can introduce the players to, expanding the possibilities for alliances and storylines?
   - How can the NPCs evolve and grow alongside the players, providing ongoing support and opportunities for collaboration based on the players' changing needs?
