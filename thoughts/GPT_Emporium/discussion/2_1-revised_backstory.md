# The Setting

Our campaign unfolds in a universe where "light travel" forms the backbone of the economy. The essential ingredients of this transportation method are dragon glass and a pearl produced by a specially bred oyster. The oyster pearls are particularly coveted, as they require skilled magical biologists and specific large-scale environments for successful cultivation.

The creators of this recipe were a mad biologist, now quarantined due to a failed experiment, and a former tycoon turned planeswalker.

The production process of the spheres themselves involves grinding the obsidian and pearl, blending them with other trace components, and then fusing them together in a furnace using antigravity spellwork to form perfect spherical lenses. These are the Light Stones, the devices enabling light travel. They work only by line of sight through mostly transparent materials, and are thus often perched in towers and other high places.

The biological source of these pearls was once a secret, with many disastrous and horrific attempts made to reproduce them. Some claim to have successfully replicated the pearls using their own special breed of oyster, but they kept their methods hidden and have mostly sold their products as off-brand replicas.

Our story starts at the end of the race to create a stone that enables travel through solid earth.

An unknown source has publicly released a manufacturing recipe that any common wizard can execute for a non-biological pearl, along with the necessary antigravity spellwork for the glass furnace that is notoriously difficult to design. No longer are biologists or oyster farms necessary to make light stones!

This has changed the game, and all of a sudden everyone wants to set up light stone manufacturing plants. There is no closing the floodgates and all the forces on the island are having to realign to this new democratization of their prized commodities.

Nevermind the zombie disease released by the elites that's ravaging the nation. We'll talk about that later.

# Avador's Expedition

Avador, our leading NPC for session zero, is an inderdimensional explorer who was contracted to find new species of oysters for the light stone biologists. As self-reliant tinkerer and adventurer himself, he relates to all the characters as adventurers in training, and takes them under his wing.

Avador operates a massive lighthouse ship that contains essentially a floating city block. It is teeming with shops and people, feels like a never-ending outdoor market, and is connected to the light network (when in range of another relay) by a massive lighthouse that is perched atop the ship's architecture.

Avador's ship is one of the few that is licensed to travel beyond the pocket dimension that makes up the entirety of the campaign world. His ship and it's mission is mostly to find new oyster species for breeding and to anchor new lightstones in other worlds for efficient future connection. This was an endeavor backed by the government as they aim to expand their Light Network, but he is in danger of his contract dying out because of the new, public, pearl recipe. His only hope as he sees it is to find the oyster or the recipe needed for the stone that transmits through solid earth.

He also has in his mind another method of travel that he is actively trying to manufacture: enchanted doorknobs that link passages to a network of hallways in his own pocket dimension. He sees this as an improvement to the light network that is limited by line of sight amplifiers, but his inventions have not yet panned out. He has finally saved enough money to get the materials for the pocket dimension's anchor. (He essentially has the money to develop the land, but hasn't connected it to the utilities or built anything on it)

# Character Motivations

As the ship arrives, players should be swept up in the excitement of a fantastical traveling magical market. Various crew members of the ship present a view of the places the ship has been and the politics involved in the communities. 

There are opportunities for different motivations and roles, tempting players with new and alien worlds. Characters and inhabitants give a view into the small town gypsy life of traders and tinkers on the road.

But the true motivations of the encounter are taking them back to the beleaguered island of the campaign that the ship originates from.

The ship has a reputation for shanghaiing people, adding an element of risk and intrigue in case players aren't enchanted with all this new fangled finery.

# The Infection

The campaign world the characters are whisked away to is plagued by a zombie infection, a byproduct of the mad biologist's immortality experiment. This is the same biologist known for first breeding the oysters used in light stone production. Their work has essentially been rendered obsolete by the pearl recipe.

The rogue infection they also are responsible for is transmitted through blood and saliva, and results in death within an hour, followed by a type of reanimation. Only 1 in 20 infected retain their self-awareness, while the rest lose control, driven by a fungal infection that drives them to attack and thus infect others.

Those who do retain control after infection though are, in essence, immortal, though their flesh continues to decay as it normally would after death. They continue to suffer from strong urges to harm other living beings and are drawn to the scent of CO2.

These beings are normally held together by many enchantments. While the more thoughtful and brave take to a "living mummification" during the death hour that generally preserves some level of flesh indefinitely.

## The Fermentation Cult

A cult has formed around using the infection and a ritualized mummification process towards lichdom.

They infect willing (and sometimes unwilling) participants in the hope of achieving the elusive self-aware infection. These rituals often result in the unintentional release of the zombie infection into nearby towns, and are esentially mass suicide events and should be handled delicately by the DM and the characters.

The cult is perpetuated by a common invention that was sold to the public to help alleviate the infection's spread. It isolates an infection of any kind on an individual to a specific body part, preventing the death and resurrection needed for the mental degradation.

These are made as bands of silver that are designed to draw a small amount of the wearer's own blood for enchantment. Even though they were once used to control the infection, alternate uses have made them a common black market currency.
