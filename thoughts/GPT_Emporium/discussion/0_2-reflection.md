# Discussion

After an [initial idea](0-backstory.md) about how to set up a session zero featuring Avador's Traveling Emporium as the gateway into the campaign, [a generalized chat with ChatGPT 3.5](0-gpt_3_5-0.md) was begun as an initial exploration into basic structure of the setting, and potential refinements to current goals and plot design.

## Player Introductions

The initial prompts produced some good things to be aware of when screening or introducing players or yourself as part of the campaign:
- Tone/Setting/Genre
- Themes
- PC Goals
- Respect, cooperation, willingness

## Player Profiling

I then attempted to ask about a profile of some player demographics that I could use to aim at potential desires.

- Exploration
- Combat
- Roleplaying
- Storytelling
- Problem-Solving
- Character Development
- Social Interaction
- Power Fantasy
- World-Building
- Immersion

At the same time I asked to consider potential needs I may be overlooking. The following is the list:

- Balanced encounters
- Character Arcs
- Variety: exploration, combat, puzzle, roleplay
- Pacing
- Open communication

## Making a Plan

I asked and had to specify my intent a couple times. I wanted a plan for how to conduct the initial episode, but it really wanted to do a pre-session pow-wow first. With some coaxing, the following came out, and seems like a good starting point

### The Plan

ChatGPT 3.5 - May2023: Certainly! Here's a plan for conducting the session itself as the "isekai's pilot episode" and introducing the players to the campaign narrative:

1. Opening Scene:
   - Set the stage with a vivid description of the surroundings and the magical ambiance of the wizard's shop.
   - Introduce the mysterious proprietor and have them welcome the characters to the shop, acknowledging their unique abilities and backstories.

2. Initial Encounter:
   - Present a minor conflict or problem that requires the characters' assistance, such as a magical artifact gone awry or a mischievous creature causing trouble in the shop.
   - Design the encounter to highlight each character's strengths and abilities, allowing them to showcase their unique skills.

3. The Proprietor's Request:
   - After the encounter, the proprietor reveals their true purpose: to recruit the characters as agents for a grand quest.
   - Explain the overarching quest or goal that forms the central narrative of the campaign and how the characters' backstories are connected to it in meaningful ways.

4. Character Hooks:
   - Provide individual plot hooks tailored to each character's backstory, goals, or motivations.
   - These hooks should offer personal stakes and incentives for the characters to embark on the grand quest and explore the campaign world.

5. Information and Guidance:
   - The proprietor shares important information about the campaign world, the main antagonist, or the current state of affairs.
   - Provide the characters with relevant knowledge, maps, or resources that can assist them on their journey.

6. Establishing Relationships:
   - Encourage the characters to interact with each other and the NPCs in the shop.
   - Foster roleplaying opportunities for the characters to develop relationships, alliances, or conflicts, helping to establish a cohesive group dynamic.

7. The Departure:
   - Conclude the session by having the proprietor open a portal or magical gateway that transports the characters from the wizard's shop to the starting location of the campaign.
   - Describe the new surroundings and atmosphere, setting the stage for their first steps into the wider world.

8. Session Recap and Feedback:
   - Take a moment to recap the key events of the session, emphasizing the characters' connections, goals, and the central quest.
   - Encourage players to provide feedback, ask questions, and share their thoughts on the session and their characters' experiences.

By following this plan, you can conduct a session that functions as the pilot episode of the "isekai" campaign, introducing the players to the campaign narrative, establishing character connections, and setting the stage for their adventures in the larger campaign world.

# Reflection

## Geography

The campaign is centered on a pocket universe, or bubble dimension. Whatever you want to call it to fit your game system. In this universe is a large island that drops off into literal space after a mile or so away from the island at sea (or under earth). It is a sphere centered around the volcano of the island, which was what was summoned.

## Theme

Everything is light or frequency themed. Vibrations, sound, light, change. This is the general theme, but it opens up the possibility of flavors of magic based on colors and music, and even chi or body rhythms.

This has led mainly to lots of lighthouses. Old architecture to represent solid integration of the systems. The magic is not a fleeting thing, it's been around as long as the architecture.

## Tone

The tone should be whimsically offbeat, but jarring at times, either from it's lack of restraint, or it's stunning and unusual parallels to our own reality.

# Profiling

I like the "exploration, combat, puzzle, roleplay" division of potential player and character intents, but I don't want to be restricted by them. I do want to make custom playing card suits that represent these intent categories though. It will make for fun prophesy and in-game games.

It also gives me a way of finding what the players prefer, and who dominates each.

There is always a social structure, even if you don't notice.

# The Factions

Main characters in charge of each faction:
- An adult blue dragon (secretly the missing planeswalker) who runs the light stone industry
- The quarantined mad biologist (lich) who helped make the light stones, and is now leading the search for a cure (to her own infection)
- The fungal hive mind of the "church of fermentation" trying to promote the rapid spread of itself outside the bubble universe
- The abyssal "gnome" inhabitants from whence the pocket universe came. A homebrew creature in the mind of a terribly powerful and terrifying thing in an unassuming shell. They are ambivalent to anyone unless provoked.
	- They only look like gnomes because we cannot fathom their true form. They appear as short garden gnomes as in the Brothers Grimm's, "The Earth Gnomes" or "Snow White and Rose Red", and are hence very churlish in creative and silly ways, and quick to anger. They are very proud culturally of the following:
		- Their nimbleness and trim or dainty size.
		- Their white beards, at least half as long as they are when able
		- Their often exquisitely tailored and practical clothes
	- Children and animals seem unaffected by their powerful magic. That is their main limitation, but otherwise they appear to effect the universe as incredibly powerful, sorcerous, magical beings by nature.
	- They can once a day permanently change people into equivalent animals using something akin to "true polymorph" that lasts until the gnome's death breaks the curse.
	- 3 times a day they can magically distract a group of people while they escape
	- They often go unnoticed by adults, and could walk through a crowded street of people in plain sight unnoticed unless being specifically looked for.
	- They, like dragons, are drawn to hoard what they see as valuable, often precious jewels

## Mutual Goals

The _Dragons_ are allied with the _Wizards_ and the exiled lich as their figurehead, but they fight for control of this partnership that maintains the supremacy of the lightstone industry.

The _Gnomes_ are many, solitary, unaligned, and very territorial between themselves. They live in vast complexes of tunnels in the earth, and roam the wilderness or population centers to steal or "borrow" things (as they justify it. "we borrow for the safekeeping of all!") and then retreat into their fortresses. They seem to appear out of nowhere and a female or child has never been seen. They are secretly the mature "fruit" of a fungus. This fungus was secretly genetically engineered by the mad biologist as an immortality experiment, and after it escaped it started the infection.

The _Church of Fermentation_ is the fanatic population that wants to overthrow the system. Their arguments are mostly sold as a population control argument (or just a control argument) in a finite bubble space, but they seek to leave their lives behind and make use of the infected's potential for lichdom. Their local branch mottos have all latched on to some form of "don't expand, distill"

# Brainstorming

Using Avador's Traveling Emporium as the setting for session zero, and the gateway in and out of the "isekai" universe.

## Session Zero Plan

- Opening scene
	- what are the characters' initial ideas of normal?
	- what would make them leave? willingly or unwillingly
- Avador's Traveling Emporium
	- The wondrous explorer searching for new oysters or transportation tech
	- secretly looking for new people, willing or not
		- for what? why?
	- All encounters happen simultaneously: prismatic jewel that splits the ship into temporary "images"
- Entice with "false" main hook publicly told
- Shanghai if unwilling
	- why? why would the crew be evil enough if they are so seemingly friendly? What benefit do they get out of it?
- Pre-made interactions with the crew with sub-hooks
	- Information and guidance. 
	- Equipment and customization
	- Relationships: new friends and enemies
- The Departure

# Next Steps

After all of these thoughts and interactions, [some next steps are presented](0-next_prompts.md).
