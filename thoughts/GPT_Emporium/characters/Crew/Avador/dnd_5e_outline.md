Creating a character sheet for Avador using Dungeons and Dragons 5e rules involves quite a bit of decision-making based on the information we have about him. For now, let's focus on the key aspects of Avador's character sheet. We've decided he's a high-level wizard with potentially a level or two in rogue or fighter.

Here's a high-level overview:

**Name:** Avador Starlance
**Race:** Human (Variant)
**Class:** Wizard (Abjuration or Divination might fit well with his curiosity and protective nature) - Level 15; Rogue (Swashbuckler subclass to reflect his charm and people skills) - Level 3; Fighter - Level 2.
**Background:** Sailor/Pirate (reflecting his lifestyle aboard a spaceship)
**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral (reflecting his unpredictable nature and quest)

**Ability Scores** (using standard point array and bonuses from race and level):
- **Strength:** 10
- **Dexterity:** 14 (essential for his roguish skills)
- **Constitution:** 13 (necessary for long travels and space escapades)
- **Intelligence:** 15 + 1 (variant human bonus) (crucial for a wizard)
- **Wisdom:** 12
- **Charisma:** 14 + 1 (variant human bonus) (reflects his people skills)

**Proficiencies:** Arcana, History, Insight, Perception, Persuasion, Deception (reflects his cunning)

**Languages:** Common, one additional of your choice

**Feats:**
- Observant (Reflects his sharp mind and attention to detail)
- Spell Sniper or War Caster (Given his magical prowess)

**Spells:** A mix of exploration-based, defensive, and utility spells would suit Avador's character well. As a high-level wizard, he would have a wide array of spells to choose from.

**Equipment:** Beyond the standard adventurer's kit, Avador would have the items we discussed earlier.

Note that this is just a high-level summary and leaves out a lot of detail - it does not include his detailed spell list, all his class and subclass features, his hit points, etc. Additionally, these choices reflect my interpretation of Avador based on the information you've provided - you might make different choices to better fit your vision of his character! 

Remember that D&D is all about creating a character that is fun and compelling for you, and fitting for the story you and your group want to tell. So feel free to modify this outline as you see fit!
