These are great questions that will surely provide depth and insight into your characters. They touch on the past, present, future, personal relationships, aspirations, regrets, and core values. Here are some additional questions that could help you dive deeper into your characters' motivations, fears, and personal growth, especially in the context of the complex, multi-dimensional setting you're working with:

1. **What is your personal philosophy or creed?** This could reveal a lot about a character's guiding principles and how they approach life, decisions, and relationships.

2. **What are your thoughts on authority and rules? Do you follow, bend, or break them, and why?** Given the various factions and power dynamics on the ship, it would be interesting to explore how characters relate to the concept of authority.

3. **What fears or insecurities do you have, and how do these impact your actions and decisions?** Everyone has fears, and understanding these can shed light on a character's motivations and potential internal conflicts.

4. **What do you think of the different factions on the ship and their motivations? Where do your loyalties lie?** This question can provide a sense of a character's political and social alignments, and the kind of alliances or conflicts they might have.

5. **How do you respond to conflict and disagreement?** This can give a sense of the character's emotional intelligence, maturity, and problem-solving approach.

6. **How do you deal with loss or failure?** This can provide insight into resilience, coping mechanisms, and personal growth.

7. **What would you do if you could no longer stay on the ship?** This can help explore a character's attachment to the ship and its community, their adaptability, and how they might handle drastic changes.

8. **How has traveling through different dimensions affected your perspective on life and your place in the universe?** This could provide a sense of a character's worldview and philosophical musings, and how these experiences have shaped them.

9. **What is your opinion on shanghaiing? Have you been involved in it, or would you ever consider doing it, and why?** This can give a sense of a character's ethical boundaries and possible darker or morally ambiguous aspects.

10. **What is a significant memory or experience from a different dimension that has deeply impacted you?** This can provide a sense of the unique experiences these characters have had and how they have been affected by their multi-dimensional travels.

Remember, it's essential to consider how a character might evolve over time in response to their experiences and interactions with others. Characters who change and grow tend to be more compelling and relatable.
