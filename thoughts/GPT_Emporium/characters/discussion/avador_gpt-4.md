Assume Avador knows about the shanghaiing practiced used on the ship. He may not be directly involved, but he isn't stupid, and he isn't so noble. He's a smooth talker, and he's crafty and has an insatiable need for something he can't quite understand. He's the Captain Ahab of his world, but without a white whale and with better people skills.

He doesn't know what he hunts or why, he just needs something that's always out of reach. People love him and don't seem to notice this hunger. He's a very pretty person, and he always seems to end up as people's friend, even when he isn't trustworthy.

Could you adjust your answers accordingly please?

Certainly, let's adjust Avador's character accordingly:

1. **Personal Philosophy or Creed:** "The universe is a vast ocean of wonders waiting to be discovered. It's the chase that keeps me going, the next big find, the next thrilling secret. I don't know what I'm looking for, but I'll know when I find it."

2. **Thoughts on Authority and Rules:** "Rules are tools, they keep order, sure. But sometimes they need to be bent, or re-interpreted, for the greater good. I play by my own rules on this ship. Everyone knows it, and they've come to respect it."

3. **Fears or Insecurities:** "My greatest fear? Reaching the end of the voyage without finding what I'm searching for. As for insecurity, the thought of being seen as untrustworthy haunts me. It's a delicate dance, maintaining respect while bending the rules."

4. **Opinion on the Factions:** "Factions are part of the ship's ecosystem. It's all a big game, and I'm playing to win. I respect them, and they respect me. We're all in this for our own reasons, after all."

5. **Response to Conflict:** "Every conflict is an opportunity in disguise. Negotiation, compromise, a dash of charm - that's my approach. People seem to trust me, even when they shouldn't."

6. **Handling Loss or Failure:** "Failure is just another challenge to overcome. I've lost people, sure. It's hard. But it's the price of the voyage. As for my own failures, they're stepping stones on the path to that elusive find."

7. **If No Longer Able to Stay on the Ship:** "I'm a man of the cosmic seas. If I'm not on this ship, I'd feel like a fish out of water. But, life has a way of surprising you. I'm certain I'd find a new chase, a new adventure."

8. **Effects of Dimensional Travel:** "Every new dimension is a shot at finding what I seek. It's an addicting thrill, stepping into the unknown. The vastness and variety of it all... it's humbling, and infinitely exciting."

9. **Opinion on Shanghaiing:** "I don't directly partake in it, but it's a necessary evil. This ship needs a crew, and not everyone steps aboard willingly at first. But given time, they find their place, their purpose. Just like I have."

10. **Significant Memory from Another Dimension:** "There was this one time... I found a book in a dimension of pure shadow. When I opened it, it was filled with blank pages. But when I closed it, I swear I could hear it whispering tales of other worlds. That's the chase, that's the thrill I live for."

Absolutely, I'd be happy to reimagine Avador's responses to your original questions:

1. **Moment of Struggle:** "Taking command of this ship was the biggest challenge of my life. I was young and inexperienced. It was... overwhelming. But I learned to rely on my instincts, and more importantly, on my crew. We've made it this far together."

2. **Regretful Decision:** "When I first realized my insatiable hunger for something more, I neglected my relationships. I pushed people away, consumed by my chase. Some bridges were burnt, yes, but I've come to value companionship just as much as the thrill of the chase."

3. **Family Relationships:** "I don't have much family to speak of. The crew, they've become my family. Our bond has grown stronger with every voyage, every challenge faced together. And I'd do anything to protect them."

4. **Self-Discovery:** "I've learned that I have a knack for leadership, but also that it's a double-edged sword. I can rally people, inspire them, but it's a heavy burden, carrying their hopes and dreams. Yet, I wouldn't trade it for anything."

5. **Learned Lessons:** "People are more resilient than they appear, and everyone has their own tale to tell. Listen to them, respect them, and they will follow you to the ends of the universe."

6. **Greatest Accomplishment:** "Maintaining harmony aboard this ship, against all odds. We've seen things, been places that would shatter lesser crews. But we're still here, still together. That's my greatest accomplishment."

7. **Future Goals:** "I want to find what I've been searching for, even though I don't know what it is. And when I do, I want to share it with my crew. They've been there through thick and thin, and they deserve the prize as much as I do."

8. **Admired Qualities:** "Resilience, loyalty, the ability to dream despite adversity. These are the traits I admire most. They're what keep this ship afloat."

9. **Community Challenges:** "Shanghaiing has always been a harsh reality of our existence. But we strive to integrate these reluctant crew members, make them feel at home. Over time, most come to see the value in our shared journey."

10. **Passion:** "Exploration. The thrill of diving into the unknown, the anticipation of discovering something new. That's what fuels me, and I believe it's the driving force behind humanity's progress."
