# Meta-Prompt Exploration

## Give Context

### First

Hello there, I'm a dungeon master for a small group of players, and I'm trying to add some intent, subtlety, and consistency to the framework I have already made for my campaign. I have run this particular campaign once before, and I have a good idea of the general themes, characters, and plot that I'm trying to expand on. I would like to make it something more thoughtful, immersive, and complete.

[context for this application]

I would like to copy and paste in a few markdown file/files for you to read: first a rough summary of the setting for my campaign, and then some additional context that I'd like to use to help inform further conversation.

Could you please wait for me to paste in this information? I then have some topics I'd like to discuss afterwards if you're willing.

### Next

To start, this is a rough draft for a summary of the setting and backstory for the campaign world:

### Finally

I appreciate your observations! I will have to take some time to process them. After some reflection on my own time though, I have come to wonder about some of the following [observations, characters, and ideas]. Could you please read them and then wait for some discussion topics on the material?

### Potential Need for Split - Oddball Connectors

These are some great things to think about, thank you!

If I may, I'd like to adjust our conversation based on some additional information I thought to add as refinement. Could you please read it? I have some prepared discussion topics to follow.

### Prompts

I appreciate your help!

With all this in mind, could you please address the following with as much detail as you can? Please do your best to make sure your observations are based on the context given for the setting and backgrounds provided. 

I'd also love it if you could double check your work and inform me what implications your observations may have on the campaign world itself. Do the implications make sense with respect to the information from the backstory? Please help point out anything you may notice that doesn't line up:
