# The Question of "Evil"

What is evil? What is a villain?

Is it a matter of perspective? Are there those without a moral code? Are people's cruel acts intentional and unapologetic?

That's really how you know what is within a character's personality. What to they do, what do they feel shame for, going as so far as to apologize. It shows some have a value system, and can violate it, intentionally or otherwise. Such value systems may change in ways as to suit an individuals needs, or for no reason at all.

One of the biggest problems with creating an adversary or villain to drive a plot is making them believable.

This is not necessarily because such a person may not exist, as a jaded individual, I believe they might. It's more about being able to look past one's self. To reduce and twist your basic beliefs in such a way as to end up with something that may exist, but is different than you.

These twisted personalities are often hard to reconcile when they go against some of the most basic tenants of what a villain might do.
