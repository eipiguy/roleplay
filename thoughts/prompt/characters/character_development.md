# Context For This Application

To be used in the prompting tree from the base [context file](../context.md)]:

I would like to develop some characters that will be used for an upcoming session. I have some ideas about who they are, and I have role-played them before. Could you please help me give them a bit more life and depth?

# Cast of Characters

I have a few bare bones outlines for a set of characters that I'd like to use as a basis to expand upon while working on the main ones and their development. I'd appreciate it if you could please read it. I want you to have enough information to keep relationships straight as I'm  asking questions, and I want you to have enough context to be able to speak intelligently about their interpersonal dynamics.

# Introspective Priming

Now you have a bit of background on the world for the characters I'm trying to develop, and a basic cast of the people around the current main characters I'd like to flesh out, lets talk about characters in general first, and what gives them depth to start with.

I've been doing some of thinking about what questions you need to ask to find out who a person really is. Not just on-the-nose, worksheet questions, but real questions that actually help you tease out how someone thinks and responds to situations, even when they are actively putting on a front or unintentionally trying to save face. Even when It's subtle or hard to empathize with.

I have some initial ideas as follows, but I'd like your input as well. Given the context of what I'm trying to do, what are some other things I might ask to give more relevant context to my main characters in their situation?
