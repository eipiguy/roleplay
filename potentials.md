## Priority through Turns

Resolutions and the potentials for them are enforced through priority. There is a turn order that affects the chance to influence each next resolution.

Each type of resolution has a turn order associated with it. When a person contributes to a resolution of that type, they are advanced in that priority. When they use resources of that type they are moved back.

At each opportunity for a resolution of a particular type, the highest priority is selected as the next one.

## Plot

The story must advance. Divide the total time for the episode by the number of "chapters" for the longest plot path.

Set a countdown timer for that long, and work towards advancing that plot point. If they go for it early, just leave the clock running and have some fun.

If they don't go for the plot hook, no matter how you present it, then when the timer runs out, reset it, and take the next shortest path.

Continue trying to advance that path's next plot hook now, and repeat until you're left with the forcing path.
